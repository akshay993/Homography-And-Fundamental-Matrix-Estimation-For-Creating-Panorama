# Homography-And-Fundamental-Matrix-Estimation-For-Creating-Panorama

Implemented in MATLAB

The Project is done for the Computer Vision and Image Processing class CSE573.

Key Points:

- Used the Harris Corner Detector algorithm for corner detection for scale-invariant features.
- Implemented RANSAC to estimate a homography mapping from one image onto the other.
- Wrapped one image onto the other using the estimated transform and created a new image to hold the panorama.
